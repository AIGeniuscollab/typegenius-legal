        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p style="color: #667eea; font-weight: bold;">TypeGenius AI Keyboard</p>
    </div>

    <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: February 1, 2026 | Last Updated: February 26, 2026</p>

    <p>At TypeGenius ("we," "our," or "us"), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our TypeGenius AI Keyboard mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Key Points:</strong>
        <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">
            <li>We do NOT store your typed text or voice recordings after processing</li>
            <li>We do NOT sell your personal data to third parties</li>
            <li>We do NOT use your data for advertising purposes</li>
            <li>All data transmission is encrypted using industry-standard protocols</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>1. How TypeGenius Works</h2>

    <p>TypeGenius functions as an Input Method Editor (IME) on your device. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Standard typing (without AI features) is processed entirely on your device. We do NOT transmit your keystrokes to any server during normal typing.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Feature Processing:</strong> When you explicitly activate AI features (voice transcription, grammar correction, text enhancement, Genius), only that specific text is securely transmitted to our servers for processing.</li>
        <li><strong>No Keystroke Logging:</strong> We do NOT log, store, or analyze your typing patterns, passwords, or any text you type unless you explicitly use an AI feature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Text for AI Processing:</strong> When you use AI features (voice-to-text, grammar correction, text enhancement, translation, Genius), we temporarily process the text you submit.</li>
        <li><strong>Genius Instructions and Context:</strong> When you use the Genius feature, we process the instruction you type and, if you have selected text, the selected text you choose to include as context. Both are sent to our servers and third-party AI providers for processing and are not retained afterward.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice Recordings:</strong> When you use voice transcription, audio is transmitted to our servers, processed, and immediately deleted.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Submissions:</strong> If you use our in-app "Help Us Improve" feedback form, we collect the feedback responses you provide (what you love, what could be better, feature requests). This information is stored in our database to help us improve the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Address (Optional):</strong> You may optionally provide your email address when submitting feedback, if you would like us to follow up. We will only use this email to respond to your specific feedback and for no other purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Support Communications:</strong> If you contact us for support, we may collect your email address and the content of your communications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Instance Identifier:</strong> A randomly generated UUID to manage your subscription and daily usage limits. This identifier is NOT linked to your device hardware, personal identity, or any account. It is stored on our server alongside usage records and feedback submissions to associate them with your app installation.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Counts:</strong> We track the number of times you use each AI feature (voice transcription, grammar correction, rephrasing, tone adjustment, summarization, Genius) to enforce daily usage limits. We do NOT store the content of your text.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Status:</strong> Whether you have an active Pro subscription, to determine your usage limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information (Feedback Only):</strong> If you submit feedback through the in-app form, basic device information (device name, device model, Android version) is included alongside your feedback to help us diagnose issues. This information is only collected when you actively submit the feedback form and is NOT collected during normal keyboard use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Device hardware identifiers (IMEI, serial number, etc.)</li>
        <li>Passwords or sensitive credentials</li>
        <li>Credit card or payment information (handled by Google Play)</li>
        <li>Precise location data</li>
        <li>Contacts or address book</li>
        <li>Photos, files, or other media</li>
        <li>Browsing history</li>
        <li>Crash reports or diagnostics</li>
        <li>Text typed using standard keyboard (without AI features)</li>
    </ul>
